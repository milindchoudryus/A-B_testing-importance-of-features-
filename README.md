- A/B testing is a powerful technique used to compare two different versions of something machine learning models and determine which one performs better. It’s a crucial tool for data-driven decision-making, especially in fields like marketing, product development, and data science.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐉𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐨𝐧:
𝐍𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐇𝐨): This is the default assumption we start with. It states that there’s no significant difference between the two versions being tested.
𝐀𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐇1): This is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It suggests that there is a significant difference between the versions.
𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 (α): Also known as the alpha level, it represents the threshold for statistical significance. Commonly set at 0.01 or 0.05, it helps us decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
𝐏-𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞: The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬:
𝐓-𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭: Used for comparing means between two groups (e.g., control vs. treatment).
𝐂𝐡𝐢-𝐒𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭: Applicable for categorical data (e.g., comparing conversion rates).
𝐀𝐍𝐎𝐕𝐀 (𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞) 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭: Useful when comparing means across multiple groups (more than two).

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬:
1. If the 𝐩-𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 > 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞, we accept the null hypothesis (Ho). This means there’s no significant difference between the versions.
2. If the 𝐩-𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 < 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞, we reject Ho in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). This suggests a significant difference exists.

Remember, A/B testing empowers data-driven decision-making, allowing us to optimize processes, improve user experiences, and enhance business outcomes.
